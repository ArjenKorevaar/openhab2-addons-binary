## Instructions
Download the .jar file and place it in the addons folder of OpenHAB2. The default location is at /usr/share/openhab2/addons. You may need to restart OpenHAB2 before the binding appears in an OpenHAB2 user interface (PaperUI for example).

Configure the binding by entering the hostname or IP address and port number to connect to the gateway.
