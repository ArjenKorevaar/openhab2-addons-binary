# openHAB addons binary
This repository is used to publish compiled openHAB bindings, usually from [openhab-addons](https://github.com/ArjenKorevaar/openhab-addons)

## Instructions
Download the .jar file and place it in the addons folder of openHAB.
The location of the addons folder depends on the installation type, but on Linux it can be found at ${OPENHAB_HOME}/addons.
You may need to restart openHAB before the binding appears in an openHAB user interface (PaperUI for example).
