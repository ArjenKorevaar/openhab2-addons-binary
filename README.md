# openHAB2 addons binary
This repository is used to publish compiled openHAB bindings, usually from [openhab-addons](https://github.com/ArjenKorevaar/openhab-addons)

## Instructions
Download the .jar file and place it in the addons folder of openHAB.
The default location is at /usr/share/openhab2/addons.
You may need to restart openHAB before the binding appears in an openHAB user interface (PaperUI for example).
